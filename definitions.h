 * Purpose: The purpose of this file is to act as the glue between the segments
 *          and instructions abstractions. It will contain functions in order 
 *          to create and initalize the unviversal machine. It will also have 
 *          functions to beginning running the machine and processing command 
 *          line instructions.
